The Simd Library is a free open source image processing library, designed for C and C++ programmers. 
It provides many useful high performance algorithms for image processing such as: 
pixel format conversion, image scaling and filtration, extraction of statistic information from images, motion detection,
object detection (HAAR and LBP classifier cascades) and classification, neural network.

The algorithms are optimized with using of different SIMD CPU extensions. 
In particular the library supports following CPU extensions: 
SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX and AVX2 for x86/x64, VMX(Altivec) and VSX(Power7) for PowerPC, NEON for ARM.

The Simd Library has C API and also contains useful C++ classes and functions to facilitate access to C API. 
The library supports dynamic and static linking, 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux, 
MSVS and G++ compilers, MSVS project and CMake build systems.
